## FAQ

#### Downloads folder keeps resetting

In Flatpak, folder access is temporary and resets after a session restart because static access can't be requested. To set a permanent downloads folder, grant access in advance using Flatseal or run:

```sh
flatpak override --user io.github.nozwock.Packet --filesystem='/path/to/your/folder/here'
```
